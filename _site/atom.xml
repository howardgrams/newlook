This past week we had a night with exceptionally clear and transparent skies. I was able to image a couple of new objects as well as take a fresh look at some old favorites. Among my old favorites, I can’t resist reshowing the Horsehead and the Flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flame Nebula and Horsehead Nebula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;     (35 min total exposure Jan 27, 2022)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flame Nebula and the Horsehead Nebula are part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, a large  star-forming region. They are separated from each other by about half a degree – approximately the diameter of the full moon. The famous Orion Nebula is also a part of this complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darkness of the Horsehead (B 33) is caused mostly by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it. It stands out in stark contrast to the bright reddish emission nebula IC 434 behind it. Other nearby objects include NGC 2023, IC 435 and IC 432, all of which are reflection nebulae.
(Reflection nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust that reflect the light from nearby or internal sources, like fog around a car headlight.)
The very bright star Zeta Orionis (the left-most star in Orion’s belt) is a foreground star, not associated with the Orion Molecular Cloud components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source supernova exploded some 5,000 to 8,000 years ago, and the remnants have since expanded to cover an area roughly 3 degrees in diameter (about 6 times the diameter, or 36 times the area, of the full moon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern part and the western part comprise the brightest part of the expanding cloud of debris  from the exploding star, while Pickering’s Triangle is a more diffuse and spread out remnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veil continues to balloon outward. Photos taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 compared with those from 2015 clearly show individual filaments on the move. The strands comprising the eastern arc of the Veil appear especially bright because we’re viewing them edge-on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Howard Grams</name><email>howardgrams@yahoo.com</email></author><category term="nebula" /><summary type="html">The entire Veil Nebula (also known as the Cygnus Loop) is BIG - it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pickering’s Triangle is a tangle of wormy filaments and vacant holes that narrows into a bright goatee of sorts. 
It is much fainter than the Eastern Veil and the Western Veil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pickering’s Triangle wasn’t discovered until it was found photographically in 1904 by Williamina Fleming. However, as was customary at the time, her observatory director, Edward Charles Pickering, was credited with the discovery.
Since it had not yet been discovered when the NGC catalog was created, it has no NGC number although some sources refer to it as NGC 6764 or NGC 6769.
 You will notice another small patch of the Veil just below Pickering’s Triangle in this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had taken some images of the Veil last year but was not happy enough with them to share in this blog.  Recent longer and less hazy nights allowed me to take some considerably longer exposure images to capture more detail.

&lt;p&gt;The Western Veil, NGC 6960, is sometimes known as the “Witch’s Broom”. This section is centered behind the bright star 52 Cygni. The right half in this image looks like a sharp fang with a darker center. The left half divides into parallel ribbons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern and the western Veils are visible portions of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. The source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the Sun which exploded between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. The remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Howard Grams</name><email>howardgrams@yahoo.com</email></author><category term="nebula" /><category term="ngc6960" /><summary type="html">The large and extensive Veil Nebula deserves another look.

&lt;p&gt;Around 6000 BC, not too long before the Egyptians built their first pyramid, a supergiant star some twenty times more massive than the Sun collapsed and rebounded in a spectacular supernova explosion. A glowing remnant, the Veil Nebula, has been expanding in the death-star’s wake ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veil continues to balloon outward. Photos taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 compared with those from 2015 clearly show individual filaments on the move.

The Crescent Nebula is a faint, loop-shaped nebula forming a partial squashed circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the short nights and hazy summer skies, this time of year is not very favorable for amateur astronomers and our telescopes.
 But we finally had a decent clear moonless night earlier this week and I took advantage of it to observe this faint object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crescent Nebula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;     (30 min total exposure Aug 6, 2021)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crescent Nebula (or NGC 6888) is about 4700 light years away from us. It is the result of a massive star that is near the end of its life and is losing mass at an incredibly high rate -  equivalent to the mass of the Sun about every 10,000 years. That material is expanding and colliding with and energizing slower moving material that was previously ejected by the star when it became a red giant several hundred thousand years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central star will probably undergo a supernova explosion sometime in the next million years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I have never seen anyone else say so, but the Crescent Nebula brings to my  mind an impression of a jellyfish swimming through the starfield formed by the Milky Way stars shinging through it.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Howard Grams</name><email>howardgrams@yahoo.com</email></author><category term="nebula" /><category term="ngc6888" /><summary type="html">Finally, a new object worth sharing: The Crescent Nebula is a faint, loop-shaped nebula forming a partial squashed circle.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Spiral Galaxies from different angles of view</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/galaxy/Spiral-Galaxies-from-different-angles-of-view/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spiral Galaxies from different angles of view" /><published>2021-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/galaxy/Spiral%20Galaxies%20from%20different%20angles%20of%20view</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/galaxy/Spiral-Galaxies-from-different-angles-of-view/">&lt;p&gt;Here are three different faint spiral galaxies that look quite different since we view them from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NGC 1232 is about 70 million light years away from us, meaning that the photons of light that I captured with my telescope and camera were emitted by stars in the galaxy back when dinosaurs were still roaming the earth.

&lt;p&gt;This galaxy contains millions of stars arranged in several spiral arms with dark lanes in interstellar dust sprinkled between them. These spiral arms are curiously bent and not gently curved as in more typical galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we see a satellite galaxy - NGC 1232A. This is somewhat reminiscent of the Whirlpool galaxy and its satellite neighbor. Click
&lt;a href=&quot;../Whirlpool-Galaxy/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the view I posted a year ago of the Whirlpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NGC 7331 is about 49 light years away from us. In this image, we also see four small fainter galaxies, NGC 7335, NGC 7336, NGC 7337 and NGC 7340. These four are sometimes referred to as “fleas” to NGC 7331 but in fact they are variously six to eight times as far away from us and have no relationship whatever to NGC 7331.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks rather like the popular image of a flying saucer.
We see the typical bulge around the galaxy nucleus and a definite 
dark dust lane at the galaxy equator, bisecting the spindle that we view. 
It is sometimes referred to as the Silver Sliver Galaxy.
 NGC 891 is about 30 million light years away from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we could travel across space and time to see our own galaxy from the outside looking in, it would probably look a lot like 
NGC 891. Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore once said that the galaxy looks like “two fried eggs clapped back to back.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Howard Grams</name><email>howardgrams@yahoo.com</email></author><category term="galaxy" /><category term="ngc1232" /><category term="ngc7331" /><category term="ngc891" /><summary type="html">Here are three different faint spiral galaxies that look quite different since we view them from different angles.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Running Man Nebula</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/nebula/open/Running-Man-Nebula/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Running Man Nebula" /><published>2021-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/nebula/open/Running%20Man%20Nebula</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/nebula/open/Running-Man-Nebula/">&lt;p&gt;Following a stretch of poor weather, I got a chance to take the telescope out again the other night and got a good look at a somewhat whimsical space ghost - the Running Man Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Running Man (sometimes called the Ghost Nebula) vaguely resembles the shape of a man sprinting, with his huge arms in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Running Man nebula comprises three separate reflection nebulae, NGC 1973, NGC 1975, and NGC 1977 that are divided by darker regions that form the man himself. It also includes the open cluster NGC 1981. The brightest portion (NGC 1977) was discovered in 1786. The two smaller nebulae were first noted in 1862 and 1864.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection nebulae don’t emit light of their own, instead being made of dust that is lit up by nearby embedded young stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole region is just a half degree (i.e. the width of the moon) north of the great Orion Nebula that I previously shared &lt;a href=&quot;../Orion-Nebula/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heart Nebula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;     (15 min exposure Dec 14, 2020)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sh2-190_2020-12-14T22_08_07_Stack_16bits_300frames_900s_bin25pc_stitch+pse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heart Nebula seen using Celestron RASA 8 and ZWO ASI183MC&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had problems getting my usual notations to appear and disappear by moving the mouse, so here 
is the image with notations.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heart Nebula with notations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sh2-190_2020-12-14T22_08_07_Stack_16bits_300frames_900s_bin25pc_stitch+pse_notes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heart Nebula seen using Celestron RASA 8 and ZWO ASI183MC&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heart Nebula, IC 1805 or Sharpless 2-190, lies about 7500 light years away from Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heart Nebula’s intense red output is driven by the radiation emanating from a small group of stars near the nebula’s center. This open cluster of stars, known as Collinder 26 or Melotte 15, contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction of our Sun’s mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. A separate portion of NGC 896 is cataloged as IC 1795. The other parts of the Heart Nebula are very faint and visible only in hotographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby open star cluster NGC 1027 contains about 50 stars, many in four prominent mutually intersecting star chains.  It is not physically associated with the Heart Nebula – it lies in the foreground, about 3,000 light years away from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Heart Nebula is a large object, larger than the field of view of my telescope/camera combination, I had to take four separate images offset from each other and then combine them together into a mosaic. This is the reason for the irregular edges.&lt;/p&gt;
