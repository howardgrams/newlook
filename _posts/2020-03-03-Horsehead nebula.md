The Horsehead Nebula consists of a cloud of ionized gas lit from within by young, hot stars; a dark cloud containing interstellar dust lies immediately in front. The dust absorbs the light from part of the ionized cloud. A portion of this dark cloud has a shape somewhat resembling a horseâ€™s head. The nebula is located 1,300 light-years from the Sun.

The Horsehead Nebula is a prime target for many amateur astronomers, despite the difficulty many have viewing it. Upgrades in technology have made observations easier with inexpensive equipment, but it can still be a challenge to pick out of the sky. Glare from a nearby star makes it difficult to spot, as does its small size.
