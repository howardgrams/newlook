And now, for something completely different. . .

When early astronomer William Herschel (he discovered the planet Uranus in 1781) was studying the Milky Way, he reported that there appeared to be "a hole in the sky" in several places. The nature of these dark areas was not understood until the 1940s when Dutch-American astronomer Bart J. Bok proposed that they were areas of star formation, sometimes called dark nebulae. One such region is the molecular cloud Barnard 64. 
Interestingly, it is found quite close to globular cluster M9. (Click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-26-Globular Clusters %} ) to see my previous post about globular clusters.)

According to Burnham's Celestial Handbook, Herschel had the whimsical idea that a nearby globular cluster might have formed from the "missing" stars.

 The Snake Nebula, Barnard 72, is an S-shaped dark nebula, appropriately enough in the constellation Ophiuchus the Serpent Bearer. 
 Smaller, isolated dark nebulae get their own designation: Bok globules. Bok globules are cool clouds of gas and dust that look like drops of black paint. Usually, multiple star systems are forming inside.
 The dark blobs B68, B69 and B70 below the Snake Nebula are good examples of Bok globules.

You can see that the Snake and its neighbors are silhouetted against a much "busier" part of the Milky Way.
B68 is relatively small and nearby, a mere 500 light-years away. It’s extremely low in mass, at just twice the mass of our Sun,
and it’s quite small in extent, with a diameter of approximately half a light-year.

Dark nebulae give off no light of their own and they don’t reflect light from nearby stars. We see one like Barnard's E only because  lies closer to us than the Milky Way behind it.

As you can see, the B143 portion of Barnard's E is much darker and denser than the B142 portion.

Finally, here's B104, a dark nebula taking the form of the letter "L", sometimes called the Fish Hook Nebula.

You will have noticed that all these dark nebulae are designated as Barnard or B objects.
Astronomer Edward  Barnard compiled his Catalogue of Dark Markings in the Sky, or the Barnard Catalogue for short. The nebulae listed therein have become known as Barnard objects. The original catalogue listed 182 nebulae, while the final 1927 version lists 369.

I hope you have enjoyed seeing this small sample of Barnard dark nebulae.

Comments for possible future use:

Black and roughly triangular, little Barnard 86 (4.5' by 3') stands out dramatically in the Sagittarius starcloud through any telescope from a 4-inch RFT on up. The adjacent open cluster NGC 6520 heightens the contrast between darkness and light. Located 2.7° north-northwest of Gamma Sagittarii, B86 culminates only 13° above the Mount Kobau horizon, so I hadn't looked for this inkblot until John Dobson showed me 12 years ago that it could be seen from so far north. This first view of the dark mass — between an open cluster on one side and a red star on the other — with Dobson's magnificent 18-inch mirror is still the best that I have ever enjoyed.

M24, the Small Sagittarius Starcloud, harbors twin dust clouds, Barnard 92 and 93, visible in 7x50 binoculars. The two perch near the northern edge of M24, where they are very dramatic in my 8-inch f/6 Newtonian at low power. In such a telescope, the lone 12th-magnitude star in B92 is an islet in a black lake outlined by the rich star swarms of M24. B92 is 15' by 10'. In superb skies both my 8-inch and my 4-inch Astroscan can trace dark streams commencing at the western shore of B92. The longest stream can be followed 1° to the southwest edge of M24. Narrower B93 lies about 1/3° east of B92.

Occasionally I can see hints of the amorphous dark structures that photographs show between B93 and the eastern margin of the starcloud. All amateurs have favorite objects that they enjoy introducing to others. Many times I've enjoyed listening to neophytes' reactions when they're shown B92 and B93 for the first time.

Some of the best dark nebulae for 4- to 8-inch telescopes are found near the glorious open cluster M11 in the Scutum starcloud. The Barnard 114-118 complex begins ½° southeast of M11. From there it runs southward about 1°. Sweeping the cluster's vicinity will reveal other contrast features. Coal-black, 1°-wide Barnard 103 is 3° west of M11 midway between Alpha and Beta Scuti, at the edge of the Great Rift.

The Horsehead Nebula, or Barnard 33, is striking for its horsehead shape.
