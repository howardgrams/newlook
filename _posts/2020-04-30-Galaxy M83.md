Here is a face-on view of the barred spiral galaxy Messier 83, the southern pinwheel galaxy. (It is believed that our own Milky Way galaxy would look very much like M83 if we could view it from outside, although the Milky Way is about twice as large as M83 is.)  Notice the bright central nucleus, the well-formed  spiral arms, the central bar, and the dark dust lanes.

Here is a more wide angle view.  Bonus: the much further and fainter irregular galaxy NGC 5264 can be seen  not far from the left edge of the wide angle picture.
