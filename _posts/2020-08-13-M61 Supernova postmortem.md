I previously posted about this supernova on
[May 16]({% post_url 2020-05-16-M61 Supernova %} ) and on
[June 16]({% post_url 2020-06-16-M61 Supernova revisited %} ). Here are pictures taken at three additional dates showing how the supernova has faded back to invisibility.

This supernova (officially named SN 2020jfo) was first discovered on May 6 while it was still brightening after exploding.  I have cropped and rotated all these pictures so the orientation and scale match each other.

 _**M61 26 days before supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (10 min exposure April 15, 2020)<br>

 My first view of the supernova:

 _**M61 9 days after supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (10 min exposure May 15, 2020)<br>

 _**M61 37 days after supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (10 min exposure June 12, 2020)<br>

 As late as seven weeks after the supernova exploded it was still almost at peak brightness:

 _**M61 51 days after supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (6 min exposure June 26, 2020)<br>

 Finally after ten weeeks the supernova has faded very significantly:

 _**M61 69 days after supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (5 min exposure July 14, 2020)<br>

 At eleven weeks after the explosion we can hardly make it out anymore:

 _**M61 79 days after supernova exploded**_ &nbsp;&nbsp; (5 min exposure July 24, 2020)<br>

 You will notice that the three lates pictures are of significantly lower quality -- they have only half the exposure of my earlier ones. In addition, summer sky conditions here in North Carolina are much hazier than I encountered earlier in the spring. 

 There will be no further views of M61 for several months since that part of the sky is now behind the sun.
