title: A facelift for our second anniversary

It has been two years since I started this blog. 
My first post (click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-02-03-Orion Nebula %} ) to see it) 
showed the famous Orion Nebula.
It seemed to be about time for a little facelift.

Please send me an email if you notice something that seems not to be working properly after the facelift.

Although I still advise that you use a computer with its big screen to view the images on this blog. I have tried to make the site a little friendlier to users with cellphones or tablets.  In particular, you should only see mouse-over instructions for showing image annotations if you are using a computer and mouse, and you should only see tap-image and tap-away-from-image instructions if you are using a phone or tablet.
