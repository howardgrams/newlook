Comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS has been a big disappointment.  It was discovered just four months ago, on December 28, 2019.  Initially it brightened much more quickly than expected, and there were hopes that it might reach naked-eye visibility in late May when it will pass closest to the sun and to the earth.  However its nucleus was observed to fragment by early April, and as a result it started getting dimmer instead of brighter. You can see pictures of the fragments taken by the Hubble Space Telescope by clicking on [this link](https://astronomy.com/news/2020/05/hubble-captures-breakup-of-comet-atlas).

Here are two pictures that I took 25 minutes apart on April 10 of Comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS. You can easily see the comet's motion towards the lower left.

I took the following two pictures on April 20. They were taken an hour and 20 minutes apart, and you can see that the comet has moved towards the 7 o'clock position during that time. Unfortunately, my telescope cannot begin to distinguish the fragments of the nucleus!
