I'd like to call your attention to some changes and improvements to this blog in the past week or so as I try to make the site more enjoyable to browse.

- The links in the upper right take you to additional pages that aren't blog items per se when you click on them:

  - "Blog" returns you back to this main page when you click on it. (This is not new.)

  - "About" has some additional information about me, and has new information about how I take the pictures.

  - "Index" is new.  If you like galaxies, for example, it lets you easily find all the blog posts that show galaxies.

  - "Viewing Suggestions" talks about the best way to display the images in their entirity.

- Each blog post now has links at the bottom that you can click on to navigate directly to the previous (earlier date) post or to the next (later date) post. You no longer 
need to return to the main page to get to another post.

- Should you feel so-motivated, each post allows you to leave comments. These comments are visible to other readers as well as to me.

- Recent posts utilize a feature that shows notations about an image when your cursor is over the image. When you move the cursor away, the notes disappear and the original image shows again.
(You've probably noticed this one - it sort of jumps out and hits you in the face!)
This works differently on phones and other mobile devices - see the Viewing Suggestions.

- I've fixed a problem with the images in the "Double Cluster" post and the "Rosette Nebula" post. The original images were much too large and you probably did not see the right half.  You might want to go back and look at them again if you didn't "get it" when you looked at them originally.

I hope you enjoy the images and comments in these blog posts as much as I enjoy sharing them.
