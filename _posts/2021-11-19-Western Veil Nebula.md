The large and extensive Veil Nebula deserves another look. Here we see another separate portion, the western part of the nebula.

The Western Veil, NGC 6960, is sometimes known as the "Witch's Broom". This section is centered behind the bright star 52 Cygni. The right half in this image looks like a sharp fang with a darker center. The left half divides into parallel ribbons.

The eastern and the western Veils are visible portions of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. The source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the Sun which exploded between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. The remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon.
